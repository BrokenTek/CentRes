# Staged Branch
This branch is prospective functionality that may not be pulled into the master branch due to a myriad of reasons. Examples would be bad bugs, pushes that contain source of a previous version, unuseful edits and updates.

## This branch is great for adding PROSPECTIVE changes that can be tested and tried without impacting the main branch. In GitHub Deskop, you can easily switch your current working branch back and forth at the top of the GUI on the left. There should now be two options. One is main and one is staged. There will likely be more branches added but this is the current structure as of 09/09/2023.

Feel free to add something you think is helpful, a refactoring that runs faster (you can test the speed and resource usage within a browser's Inspect view by selecting the 'Performance' tab and working through the application. The 'Network' tab also has similar abilities although more focused on network usage (data sent and received attributes like size and time in milliseconds, probably less than 1 ms on localhost, but still useful to see if a refactor actually helps or not and if so, what impact it has. Adding documentation to refactors and the goals of those edits would be a very nice addition to any refactoring or code.
- Those performance metric measuring tools are useful outside of refactor testing as well.
